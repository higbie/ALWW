lNTRODUCTORY NOTE 
Of biographical handbooks of one sort or another there have 
been many. The person interested in the progress of American life 
in general, of women, of the medical profession, of the bar, of 
corporation directors, or of leaders in social life, could turn to the 
appropriate Who's Who, Directory, or Register. There he would 
secure essential information on those who had made important con- 
tributions in the field. For the labor movement, the most significant 
development of modern life, no such reference work has existed. 
This deficiency the present volume attempts to overcome. Effort 
has been made to collect the important biographical data on the 
outstanding figures in trade unionism, labor politics, workers' educa- 
tion, labor defense, cooperation, progressive farmers' groups, and 
related movements throughout the nation. To the labor movement 
itself, and to the growing number of its sympathizers and students, 
such a work should prove of service in manifold ways. Not only is 
a wealth of fascinating yet elusive information made permanently 
available; the publication of such a volume also marks a new step 
in the mental independence and self-consciousness of labor. Finally, 
in the personal histories of those who have guided the movement 
from its small beginnings to its present position of influence and 
power lies a rich fund of inspiration for further progress. 
The difficulties of collecting the life stories here presented have 
not been few. Many stalwart workers who would face any hard- 
ship or danger for the movement have shrunk from setting forth in 
print their eventful careers. Some organizations have an established 
policy against personal publicity. Other individuals, who recognized 
the value of the publication, were held back by fear of being 
victimized if they attracted attention. Thus many who with'â”'

question belong in the book are unavoidably omitted. Nevertheless, 
the response has been most gratifying. Leaders in every branch of 
labor activity have generously aided, both by furnishing information 
on their own lives and by making connections with others. To all 
of them the editors wish to express their deep appreciation and grati- 
tude. Particular thanks are due the European labor men and 
women and others abroad, who in spite of distance and the barriers 
of language loyally cooperated to make this first AMERICAN LABOR 
WHO'S WHO a world-embracing volume.

San Francisco Labor Coun. 1912; 
Intl. Holders' conv., Milwaukee; 
org. Amal. Assn. of Street Car 
Men. In San Quentin Peniten- 
tiary, Calif., serving sentence of 
life imprisonment on charges of 
murder growing out of the throw- 
ing of a bomb into Preparedness 
Day parade, San Francisco, July 
22, 1916. Bomb killed 10 people 
and injured 50. Arrested July 27, 
1916, and charged with the crime 
with his wife, Rena, Warren K. 
Billings, Israel Weinberg, and Ed- 
ward P. Nolan. In spite of con- 
tradictory testimony â” much of 
which was later proved perjured, 
and in spite of a photograph 
showing a street clock, which 
proved that the Mooneys were on 
the roof of the house where they 
lived, a mile away from the scene 
of the explosionâ”was convicted 
in Feb. 1917 and sentenced in May 
to be hanged; later a reprieve was 
granted until Dec. 13, 1918. Sen- 
tence stayed by Pres. Wilson's in- 
tervention on grounds of "effects 
on international affairs which his 
execution would greatly compli- 
cate," changed to life imprison- 
ment. Earlier death sentence nul- 
lified because of appeal pending 
when date of execution arrived. 
Because of labor agitation, Pres. 
Wilson appointed a mediation 
comssn. to investigate; they re- 
ported that in trial "the Mooney 
case soon resolved itself into a 
new aspect of an old industrial 
feud instead of a subject demand- 
ing a calm search for the truth." 
and "evidence . , . must shake 
confidence in the justice of the 
convictions"; recommended a new 
trial. Supreme Ct. refused to re- 
view case, Mar. 1, 1918. Oxman, 
chief witness in securing convic- 
tion, was proved a perjuror; not 
used in Mrs. Rena Mooney's trial; 
she was acquitted on 1 count, as 
was Weinberg; both immediately 
arrested and held in jail without 
bail on other murder indictments. 
Billings was convicted, sentenced 
to life imprisonment. Nolan re- 
leased on ball after 9 mos. in jail, 
not brought to trial; proved his 
presence in Baltimore, Md., on 
date charged with constructing 
bomb. In Nov., 1918, J. B. Dens- 
more, U. S. Director-General, ap- 
pointed by Secy, of Labor William 
B. Wilson to investigate the 
Mooney case, submitted his re- 
port, in which he said that the 
facts he had discovered "confirm 
the impression made unavoidably 
by the weak and conflicting na- 
ture of the testimony in the bomb 
cases that practically the whole 
of Fickert's case against Mooney, 
Billings and Mrs. Mooney was 
made to order." On Apr. 19, 1922, 
Dist. Atty. M. Brady, successor to 
Charles M. Fickert, appealed to 
Gov. Stephens to pardon Mooney 
and Billings, saying they were 
convicted on false testimony.
