Bomb killed 10 people and injured 50. Arrested July 27, 1916, and charged with the crime with his wife, Rena, Warren K. Billings, Israel Weinberg, and Ed- ward P. Nolan. In spite of con- tradictory testimony äóî much of which was later proved perjured, and in spite of a photograph showing a street clock, which proved that the Mooneys were on the roof of the house where they lived, a mile away from the scene of the explosionäóîwas convicted in Feb. 1917 and sentenced in May to be hanged; later a reprieve was granted until Dec. 13, 1918. Sen- tence stayed by Pres. Wilson's in- tervention on grounds of ""effects on international affairs which his execution would greatly compli- cate,"" changed to life imprison- ment. Earlier death sentence nul- lified because of appeal pending when date of execution arrived. Because of labor agitation, Pres. Wilson appointed a mediation comssn. to investigate; they re- ported that in trial ""the Mooney case soon resolved itself into a new aspect of an old industrial feud instead of a subject demand- ing a calm search for the truth."" and ""evidence . , . must shake confidence in the justice of the convictions""; recommended a new trial. Supreme Ct. refused to re- view case, Mar. 1, 1918. Oxman, chief witness in securing convic- tion, was proved a perjuror; not used in Mrs. Rena Mooney's trial; she was acquitted on 1 count, as was Weinberg; both immediately arrested and held in jail without bail on other murder indictments. Billings was convicted, sentenced to life imprisonment. Nolan re- leased on ball after 9 mos. in jail, not brought to trial; proved his presence in Baltimore, Md., on date charged with constructing bomb. In Nov., 1918, J. B. Dens- more, U. S. Director-General, ap- pointed by Secy, of Labor William B. Wilson to investigate the Mooney case, submitted his re- port, in which he said that the facts he had discovered ""confirm the impression made unavoidably by the weak and conflicting na- ture of the testimony in the bomb cases that practically the whole of Fickert's case against Mooney, Billings and Mrs. Mooney was made to order."" On Apr. 19, 1922, Dist. Atty. M. Brady, successor to Charles M. Fickert, appealed to Gov.
